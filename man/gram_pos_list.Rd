\title{Return taxons that are susceptible or resistant (unknown antibiotics phenotype are counted as resistant) to antibiotics targeting gram positive bacteria}
\usage{
gram_pos_list(abundance, delim = "; ")
}
\arguments{
\item{abundance}{A relative abundance dataframe of bacterial taxons with samples as columns and the taxonomy lineage as the rownames, separated by \code{delim}}

\item{delim}{Delimiter for the taxonomy lineage rownames. Rownames MUST contain \code{Kingdom} down to \code{Species} level separation by the \code{delim} even if no information is available for missing ranks (e.g. k__Bacteria; p__Bacteroidetes; c__Bacteroidia; ; ; ; )}
}
\value{
A dataframe of taxa abundances and whether they are susceptible or resistant to anti-gram positive antibiotics
}
\description{
Return taxons that are susceptible or resistant (unknown antibiotics phenotype are counted as resistant) to antibiotics targeting gram positive bacteria
